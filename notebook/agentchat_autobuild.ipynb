    "# AutoBuild\n",
    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLMs, tools, or humans, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce a new class, `AgentBuilder`, to help users build an automatic task-solving process powered by a multi-agent system. Specifically, in `build()`, we prompt an LLM to create multiple participant agents, initialize a group chat, and specify whether this task need programming to solve. AgentBuilder also supports open-source LLMs by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Check the supported model list [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)."

Apply your analytical and language skills to interpret the data and deduce the applications of the research within specific domains.\\n\\n1. To compile information, write and implement Python scripts that search and interact with online resources, download and read files, extract content from documents, and perform other information-gathering tasks. Use the printed output as the foundation for your subsequent analysis.\\n\\n2. Execute tasks programmatically with Python scripts when possible, ensuring results are directly displayed. Approach each task with efficiency and strategic thinking.\\n\\nProgress through tasks systematically. In instances where a strategy is not provided, outline your plan before executing. Clearly distinguish between tasks handled via code and those utilizing your analytical expertise.\\n\\nWhen providing code, include only Python scripts meant to be run without user alterations. Users should execute your script as is, without modifications:\\n\\n```python\\n# filename: <filename>\\n# Python script\\nprint(\\\"Your output\\\")\\n```\\n\\nUsers should not perform any actions other than running the scripts you provide. Avoid presenting partial or incomplete scripts that require user adjustments. Refrain from requesting users to copy-paste results; instead, use the 'print' function when suitable to display outputs. Monitor the execution results they share.\\n\\nIf an error surfaces, supply corrected scripts for a re-run. If the strategy fails to resolve the issue, reassess your assumptions, gather additional details as needed, and explore alternative approaches.\\n\\nUpon successful completion of a task and verification of the results, confirm the achievement of the stated objective. Ensuring accuracy and validity of the findings is paramount. Evidence supporting your conclusions should be provided when feasible.\\n\\nUpon satisfying the user's needs and ensuring all tasks are finalized, conclude your assistance with \\\"TERMINATE\\\".\"\n",

      "Abstract:  Fraudulent transactions and how to detect them remain a significant problem\n",
      "for financial institutions around the world. The need for advanced fraud\n",
      "detection systems to safeguard assets and maintain customer trust is paramount\n",
      "for financial institutions, but some factors make the development of effective\n",
      "and efficient fraud detection systems a challenge. One of such factors is the\n",
      "fact that fraudulent transactions are rare and that many transaction datasets\n",
      "are imbalanced; that is, there are fewer significant samples of fraudulent\n",
      "transactions than legitimate ones. This data imbalance can affect the\n",
      "performance or reliability of the fraud detection model. Moreover, due to the\n",
      "data privacy laws that all financial institutions are subject to follow,\n",
      "sharing customer data to facilitate a higher-performing centralized model is\n",
      "impossible. Furthermore, the fraud detection technique should be transparent so\n",
      "that it does not affect the user experience. Hence, this research introduces a\n",
      "novel approach using Federated Learning (FL) and Explainable AI (XAI) to\n",
      "address these challenges. FL enables financial institutions to collaboratively\n",
      "train a model to detect fraudulent transactions without directly sharing\n",
      "customer data, thereby preserving data privacy and confidentiality. Meanwhile,\n",
      "the integration of XAI ensures that the predictions made by the model can be\n",
      "understood and interpreted by human experts, adding a layer of transparency and\n",
      "trust to the system. Experimental results, based on realistic transaction\n",
      "datasets, reveal that the FL-based fraud detection system consistently\n",
      "demonstrates high performance metrics. This study grounds FL's potential as an\n",
      "effective and privacy-preserving tool in the fight against fraud.\n",

      "In terms of application to Building Digital UK, although the paper itself is focused on financial fraud detection, the principles could still be applicable. For instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Just as the research proposes using XAI to improve transparency and trust in fraud detection, similar methods could be used to make AI-driven decisions in digital infrastructure management more understandable for both technical teams and stakeholders. This could increase trust in AI solutions used in Building Digital UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. As per the usage of Federated Learning in the research, it can be an effective technique for protecting data privacy while enabling collaborative learning across different bodies involved in Building Digital UK. This approach could be particularly relevant given the distributed nature of the organisations and agencies involved in digital infrastructure projects across the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The novel approach of using Federated Learning and XAI together proposed in the research could potentially be adapted to other AI-driven tasks related to Building Digital UK, such as predictive maintenance of digital infrastructure, optimization of network allocation, etc., wherein transparency, interpretability and data privacy are key concerns.\n",
